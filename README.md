## 1. Git clone : Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.
- Syntax: **$git clone git_repository_name**
- Example : **$git clone https://www.github.com/KiranGaikwad2020/Git-Fundamentals.git**
- Here **https://www.github.com/KiranGaikwad2020/Git-Fundamentals.git** represents the repository name.


## 2. Git add : Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.
- Syntax: **$git add filename_name or filenames**
- Example : **$git add test.py**
- Here **test.py** represents the file name which is to be added in git environment.
- Variant: if you have multiple files in current working directory to add in staging area use the command **$git add .**
